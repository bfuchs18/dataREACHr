#' json_puberty: Generates a json file for Pubertal Development Scale
#'
#' This function generates a json file for the scored Pubertal Development Scale and and raw participant responses.
#' This function provides accurate json files ONLY if data is child-report and adult-reported ratings are processed using score_pds function in dataprepr and combined using proc_redcap() in dataREACHr.
#' This is only accurate for data collected in Study BREAK
#'
#' @return A string with data stored in JSON format containing meta-data for the Pubertal Development Score.
